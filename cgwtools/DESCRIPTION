Description: A 'set of tools the author has found useful for performing quick observations or evaluations of data, including a variety of ways to list objects by size, class, etc. Several other tools mimic Unix shell commands, including 'head,' 'tail,' 'pushd,' and 'popd.' The functions 'seqle' and 'reverse.seqle' mimic the base 'rle' but can search for linear sequences. The function 'splatnd' allows the user to generate zero-argument commands without the need for 'makeActiveBinding.'
